        <p style="background-color: beige;">The gentle breeze rustled through
            the trees as the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting a warm
            golden glow across the landscape. Birds chirped their final songs of
            the day, while the distant sound of a babbling brook added a
            soothing rhythm to the evening. In the meadow, wildflowers swayed,
            their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the darkening sky. It was a
            moment of quiet serenity, where time seemed to slow, allowing the
            beauty of nature to fully envelop the senses.

        <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1>
        <p>An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. The graph of it is a straight line.</p>
        
        <p>For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>y = 8x - 2</li>
            <li>a<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>3</sub> = 9</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>are some of the examples of a linear equation in two and three variables.</p>
        
        <p>Slope of intersection of two linear equations Linear equations</p>
        <ul>
            <li>y<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + a</li>
            <li>y<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + b</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>for the points P(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and Q(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is:</p>
        <p><strong>m</strong> = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
