    <h2>What is the introduction of math?</h2>
    <p>
        Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is debate over whether <del>mathematical objects</del> such as numbers and points exist naturally, or are human creations. The mathematician <strong>Benjamin Peirce</strong> called mathematics "<q>the science that draws necessary conclusions.</q>" <u>Albert Einstein</u>, on the other hand, stated that as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.

    <p>
        Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

    <h3>Introduction to Chemistry</h3>
    <p>
        <mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. You study <u>chemistry</u> because it helps you to understand the world around you. Everything you touch or taste or smell is a chemical, and each chemical interacts with other chemicals in some way or another. <b>Chemistry</b>, <i>forms the fundamental basis for biology and medicine.</i> From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis, and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows us to

    <p>
        The principles of chemistry are quite varied and are essentially important which include <del>brain</del> computer operations, <del>weather patterns, chemical industries, manufacturing fertilizers, acids, alkalis, salts, drugs, soaps, etc.</del> Chemistry plays a major determinant in meeting the human needs for food, <u>healthcare products</u>, and also other <mark>materials</mark> are aimed at improving the life's quality.
