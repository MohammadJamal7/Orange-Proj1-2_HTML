        <h1>How Do <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"
                target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a>
            Differ?</h1>

        <p><b>1)</b> The primary difference between HTML and CSS is that while
            HTML provides the structure for web pages, CSS is responsible for
            styling those pages with a range of features. If HTML code is
            considered the framework of a web page, CSS would be its
            appearance.</p>

        <p><b>2)</b> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"
                target="_blank">HTML consists of text within HTML tags</a>,
            while <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS
                is composed of declaration blocks and selectors</a>. HTML
            instructs the web browser on how to display the content of various
            tags, while CSS enhances this by adding style to those HTML
            tags.</p>
        <u>CSS can be integrated into an HTML document, but HTML cannot be used
            inside a CSS file.</u>
        <u>CSS is utilized for presentation and visual styling — to manage
            colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual appeal to sites, prepare
            images, adjust margins and borders, and more — whereas HTML is not
            intended for these purposes.</u>
